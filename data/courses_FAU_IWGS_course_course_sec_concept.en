\begin{sparagraph}[title=Objective]
\usemodule[smglom/cs]{mod?computer-science}
The course aims at giving students an
overview over the variety of digital tools and methods at the disposal of
practitioners of the humanities and social sciences, explaining their intuitions on
how/why they work (the way they do). The main goal of the course is to empower
students for their for the emerging discipline of \enquote{digital humanities and
social sciences}. In contrast to a classical course in
\sr{computer-science?CS}{computer science} which lays the \sn{mathematical} and
computational foundations which will become useful in the long run, we want to
introduce methods and tools that can become \emph{useful in the short term} and thus
generate immediate success and gratification, thus alleviating the ``programming
shock'' (the brain stops working when in contact with
\sr{computer-science?CS}{computer science} tools or \sns{computer-science?computer
scientist}) common in the humanities and social sciences.

\begin{sparagraph}[title=Original Context]
The course \enquote{Informatische Werkzeuge in den Geistes- und Sozialwissenschaften}
is a first-year, two-semester course in the bachelor program \enquote{Digitale
Geistes- und Sozialwissenschaften} (Digital Humanities and Social Sciences:
DigiHumS) at FAU Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg.
\end{sparagraph}

\begin{sparagraph}[title=Open to External Students]
Other Bachelor programs are increasingly co-opting the course as specialization option
or a key skill. There is no inherent restriction to DHSS students in this course.

There are no formal prerequisites -- after all it starts in the first semester for
DigiHumS -- but a good deal of motivation, openness towards exploring the weird and
wonderful world of digital methods and tools, and a certain perseverance in the face of
not understanding directly help tremendously and helps having fun in this course.

We do assume that students have a personal laptop, or access to a \sn{computer}
where they have admin rights, i.e.  can \sn{install} software. This is necessary
for solving the homework. In particular, smartphones and most tablet computers will
not suffice.
