\usemodule{www/slides?html} We will not give a complete introduction to the various tags
and elements of the \sn{html?HTML} language here, but refer the reader to the
\sn{html?HTML} recommendation \cite {W3C:html5} and the plethora of excellent web
tutorials. Instead we will introduce the concepts of \sn{html?HTML} markup by way
of examples.
